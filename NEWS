Changes to the rpart.plot
-------------------------

1.4-3    Dec 20, 2012
   Loosened sanity check in get.class.labs to allow for numerical error.
   Thanks for Sandrine Lunven for help with this issue.

   Tweaked vignette to refer now to the rpart package vignette (instead
   of the old rpart reports).

1.4-2    Dec 15, 2012

    Changed some code that was using "0" as a color.
    Changed some code that was doing rep(NULL, n).
    R 2.15-2 complains about the above, although previous versions
    let them slip by.

1.4-1    Oct 24, 2012

    Updates for compatibility with rpart_3.1-55 (R 2.15.2).

    Updates to the vignette (extended section on compatibility
    with plot.rpart,  added section on using split.fun, other
    touchups).

1.4-0    Oct 10, 2012

    We now minimally access internal functions in the rpart package
    (which are accessed using "rpart:::") and thus are now less
    dependent on changes to those functions.

    We now try harder to support rpart objects with "user" node lab funcs.

    The vignette now has an appendix on mvpart objects.


1.3-0    Aug 15, 2012

    There is now more white space in the split text (achieved by
    adding white space to the default eq, lt, and ge args).
    To revert to the old behaviour, explictly set these args.

    Added the trim.fun argument, invoked after each mouse click
    when interactively trimming the tree.

    Incorporated Gene Cutler's fix to get.class.labs (so we no longer
    get an incorrect error message when case weights are used).

    Added Josh Browning's heat tree example to the vignette.

    Touch-ups for the new version of plotmo (1.3-2).

    Removed unnecessary LICENSE file because rpart is now GSL-3.

1.2-2    Mar 31, 2011

    Touch-ups for the new version of plotmo (1.2-6)

1.2-1    Mar 25, 2011

    Touch-ups to the vignette.

1.2-0    Mar 24, 2011

    Added the clip.left.labs argument.
    Extended the vignette.

1.1-1    Mar 9, 2011

    We now call the object's text() function unless the object
    has a standard method ("anova", "class", "poisson" or "exp").
    We now support mvpart::mrt objects

1.1-0    Mar 5, 2011

    The prp.pdf file is now smaller, thanks to qpdf.
    Made several miscellaneous touch-ups to docs and code.
    Thanks to Jason Roberts for his feedback.

1.0-0    Feb 25, 2011

    Initial release
