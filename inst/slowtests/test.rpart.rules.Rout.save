The 'extra' argument:
    0  No extra information
    1  Number of observations in the node
    2  Class models: Classification rate (ncorrect/nobservations)
       Poisson and exp models: number of events
    3  Class models: Misclassification rate
    4  Class models: Probability per class
    5  Class models: Like 4 but don't display the fitted class
    6  Class models: Probability of second class only
    7  Class models: Like 6 but don't display the fitted class

    10 Class models: like 9 but display the probability of the second class only

The 'extra' argument:
    0  No extra information
    1  Number of observations in the node
    2  Class models: Classification rate (ncorrect/nobservations)
       Poisson and exp models: number of events
    3  Class models: Misclassification rate
    4  Class models: Probability per class
    5  Class models: Like 4 but don't display the fitted class
    6  Class models: Probability of second class only
    7  Class models: Like 6 but don't display the fitted class
    8  Class models: Probability of the fitted class
    9  Class models: Probability relative to all observations
    10 Class models: like 9 but display the probability of the second class only

    Add 100 to also display the percentage of observations in the node
